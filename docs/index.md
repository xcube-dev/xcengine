# xcengine

xcengine turns [Python Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) into:

- OGC [Earth Observation Application
  Packages](https://docs.ogc.org/bp/20-089r1.html)
- Run-anywhere Docker images that bundle datasets with an
  [xcube](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server/viewer deployment
  for easy interfacing and visualization

Earth Observation Application Packages can be complex to implement correctly.
The process can't be completely automated, but xcengine tries to simplify it
as much as possible for Jupyter Notebook authors using code analysis and
sensible defaults.

This documentation provides instructions for installing and using xcengine and
links to further resources.

xcengine is developed as part of the [Open Earth Monitor
Cyberinfrastructure](https://earthmonitor.org/) project, which has received
funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation
programme under grant agreement No. 101059548.
